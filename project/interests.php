        I have started learning Python from first semester on my <a id="mini-a" href="https://ww2.mini.pw.edu.pl/">University</a>. Since beginning, I have found it best language, I can even imagine. Simplicity,
        utility, popularity, amount of libraries are main reasons why I stayed with this language and I don't want to leave. Some of my academic projects I will present
        in Science Track Section.

        To be honest It is definitely not such pleasant such as Python but to Data processing, visualizations and machine learning is quite powerful. Since Data Visualizations
        classes I have discovered that despite IDE's appearance, user-friendliness, and syntax which are not perfect for me, we can in simple way do aesthetic charts or build
        different ML models.

        First contact with basic Machine Learning models (maybe not with simple regression but for example with SVM or gradient-boosting) was quite harsh. Not because i was not fascinated
        in such IT sector because of course I was. That was because it sound really strange. It was when I have tried to learn it by my own without required math knowledge for understanding
        ideas of some algorithms. Then when finally I have assimilated necessary topics I caught the bug. At once, I knew that for sure that is the thing I want to learn and work with in the future.
